# Amtrak DB Migration

**Project Description**

This is a delivery project for Legacy EAMS. It involves comparing "Oracle "databases that reside on their AWS platform (and hasn't been fully migrated from [eams.cloud.com](http://eams.cloud.com/)) using OpenVPN connection.

**Status**

Ongoing!

Most of the heavy lifting has now been completed by Gethin. We are now in the unit testing and integration phase which requires not so much work from Gethin. We expect to hear back from Jim as to how the testing on other parent groups of tables went. The outstanding tasks are in "File location" below and as I understand from Gethin, we expect these to be fairly quick to get past except Jim gets back to us with a slightly different scope.
